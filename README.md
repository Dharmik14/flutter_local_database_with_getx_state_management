# Local Database with Getx State Management

CRUD operations using Local DB SQLite and Getx State Management.

## Getting Started

Currently the project has two screens:
1. Add Product screen for adding products in local DB with its name, brand, price and image.
2. Product Listing Screen for displaying added products.

The getx state management listens to data changes and updates UI without reloading whole screen.

**App Result:**
